		\textbf{Small displacement assumption:}
		when light hits a thin layer, it gets reflected and refracted by the interfaces and scattered and absorbed internally.
		Since the geometric thickness $h$ of the layer is small, we assume the displacements (e.g., $\Delta x$) of light's entrance and departure locations can be neglected.
