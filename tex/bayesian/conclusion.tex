\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:bayesian:conclusion}

Procedural material models have become increasingly more popular in the industry, thanks to their flexibility, compactness, as well as easy editability.
In this chapter, we introduced a new computational framework to solve the inverse problem: the inference of procedural model parameters based on a single input image.

The first major ingredient to our solution is a \emph{Bayesian framework}, precisely defining the posterior distribution of the parameters, combining four components (priors, procedural material model, rendering operator, summary function). The second ingredient is an \emph{Bayesian inference approach} that leverages MCMC sampling to sample posterior distributions of procedural material parameters.  This technique enjoys the generality to handle both continuous and discrete model parameters and provides users additional information beyond single point estimates and allows a cleaner extension to handle discrete parameters.
