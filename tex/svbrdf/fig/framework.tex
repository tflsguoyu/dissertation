		\textbf{Our inverse rendering pipeline.} We optimize for latent vectors $\bw^+$ and $\noise$, that feed into the layers of the StyleGAN2-based MaterialGAN model. 
		The MaterialGAN generator produces material maps (diffuse albedo, normal, roughness and specular albedo), that are rendered under the captured view/light settings. 
		Finally, the renderings and measurements are compared using a combination of L2 and perceptual losses.
