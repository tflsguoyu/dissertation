{
  Physically-based rendering has become mature and commonplace in recent decades. However, the rendered results look artificial and overly perfect. Better realism needs higher fidelity detailed geometry or model complexity, which substantially increases computational power and human works. To achieve higher physical realism and enable more effective material content creation, many techniques are developed in material reflection and scattering models. We put emphasis on accurately representing and reproducing the rich visual world from micro-level scales.

  The first half of the dissertation focuses on building the bridge from micro-model to macro properties: we present an accurate appearance model for layered materials derived from microstructures to define their optical behavior and a general framework of bulk scattering in participating medium which considers the microscale effects. Consequently, in the second half, we discuss the inverse problem of retrieving the micro parameters from captured materials. 

  Our first work introduces a new unbiased layered BSDF model based on Monte Carlo simulation, whose only assumption is the layer assumption itself. Our novel position-free path formulation is fundamentally more powerful at constructing light transport paths than generic light transport algorithms applied to the particular case of flat layers. We introduce two techniques for sampling the position-free path integral, a forward path tracer with next-event estimation and a full bidirectional estimator. We show several examples featuring multiple layers with surface and volumetric scattering, surface and phase function anisotropy, and spatial variation in all parameters.

  Our second work presents a generalized framework capable of systematically and rigorously computing bulk scattering parameters beyond the far-field assumption of the Lorenz-Mie theory. Our technique accounts for microscale wave-optics effects such as diffraction and interference and interactions between nearby particles. Our framework is general, can be plugged in any renderer supporting Lorenz-Mie scattering, and allows arbitrary packing rates and particle correlation; we demonstrate this generality by computing bulk scattering parameters for many materials, including anisotropic materials and correlated media.

  Finally, we present \emph{MaterialGAN}, a deep generative convolutional network based on StyleGAN2, trained to synthesize realistic SVBRDF parameter maps. We show that MaterialGAN can be used as a robust material prior in an inverse rendering framework: we optimize its latent representation to generate material maps that match the appearance of the captured images when rendered. 

  Furthermore, we explore the inverse rendering problem of procedural material parameter estimation from photographs, presenting a unified view of the problem in a Bayesian framework. In addition to computing point estimates of the parameters by optimization, our framework uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to sample the space of plausible material parameters.
