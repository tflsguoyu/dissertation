\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:waveoptics:conclusion}

In this chapter, we introduce a new technique to systematically compute bulk scattering parameters for participating media. Built upon first principles of light transport (i.e., Maxwell electromagnetism), our technique models a translucent material as clusters of particles randomly distributed in embedding media. Our work generalizes the widely-used Lorenz-Mie theory for rigorously deriving optical properties of scattering media, and can be readily used in any radiative-based light transport simulator. 

We have demonstrated the significant effects of departing from the underlying assumptions of Lorenz-Mie theory, and the versatility for modeling a wide range of participating media by modifying the arrangement of particles within each cluster, including isotropic, anisotropic, and correlated media.
